# CONTEXT.md: Project Structure

## Summary
| Path | Role |

## Use when
- working on project structure

## Key facts
- | Path | Role |
- | ---- | ---- |
- | runpipeline.py | Thin CLI: wires show hooks into castforge.pipeline |
- | castforge.py | Resolves CastForge import (sibling checkout or venv install) |
- | publiccontract.py | Stable public feed/episode URLs and GUID prefix — do not break subscribers |

## Retrieval order
- Read `NOW.md` and concise `CONTEXT.md` as the always-read layer.
- Use this card before opening bulky `PLAN.md`, chunks, or raw source sections for this topic.
- Open raw detail only when this summary is insufficient for the task.

## Open next only if needed
- `CONTEXT.md#project-structure`
